## Team4 Project - Recipe and Restaurant Roulette

This is a Front-end developed project created by Team 4. 

This application is used to get rid of any hassle in regards of choosing a place to eat from! When clicking a cuisine (Google Places API Key is required), a random restaurant within the browser's radius will be chosen and selected to ease the process of picking a place to eat.

If you are more in the mood to cook, you are able to choose the recipe roulette option, where you can enter multiple ingredients and have recipes returned to you that contain those ingredients! A fun little cooking application.

Forked and reupdated by Logan Moss.
